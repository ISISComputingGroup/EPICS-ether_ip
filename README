"EtherIP" driver/device support module for EPICS.

Interfaces Allen Bradley PLCs (see www.ab.com) via Ethernet to EPICS IOCs under EPICS R3.13 or R3.14:
 * ControlLogix 5000,
   both original versions with separate controller and ENET module,
   and L8x series that includes a network port in the controller.
 * Compact Logix devices

See http://ics-web.sns.ornl.gov/kasemir/etherip/index.html for more.

See https://github.com/EPICSTools/etherip for a Java version of the basic communication library,
not connected to an EPCIS IOC.
